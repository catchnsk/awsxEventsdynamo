# Webhooks Platform – Planning Docs

This folder contains planning documents for the webhook architecture you shared (draw.io + screenshots). It splits the work into five streams:

1. **AWS Infrastructure**
2. **Java SDK (Java 17/21)**
3. **Spring Boot Event Validation API (EKS)**
4. **Reference Spring Boot Producer App using the SDK**
5. **Python Lambda Components**

Each doc is structured so it can be used as an engineering plan and handed to separate owners.
