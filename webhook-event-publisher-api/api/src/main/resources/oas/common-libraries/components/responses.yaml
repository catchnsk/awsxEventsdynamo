NotFound:
  description: |
     Server has not found a resource with that URI. This may be temporary and
     permanent condition. This status code is commonly used when the server
     does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or 
     when no other response is applicable. headers:

TooManyRequests:
  description: |
    When a server is under attack or just receiving a very
    large number of requests from a single party, responding
    to each with a 429 status code will consume resources.
    Therefore, servers may drop connections or take other steps
    instead of responding with the 429 status code, when limiting
    resource usage.

ServiceUnavailable:
  description: |
      temporary maintenance of service, try again later. The impLication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay will be indicated in a Retry-After header. If no Retry-After is given, the client SHOULD handle the response as it would for a 500 response.
      Note: The existence of the 503 status code does not imply that a server will use it when becoming overloaded. Servers may simply refuse the connection.
